        <p><h3>Structured Query Language(SQL):</h3><br> 
            Structured Query Language, commonly known as SQL, is a specialized programming language designed for managing, manipulating, and querying relational databases. It serves as a standard interface for interacting with databases, enabling users to perform various operations efficiently.
            <br><br>
            Purpose of SQL:
            Database Management: SQL facilitates the creation, modification, and administration of databases. It allows users to define schemas, tables, and relationships between data entities.
            
            Data Manipulation: With SQL, users can insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from databases. It provides powerful commands and functions for manipulating data records.
            
            Querying: SQL enables users to formulate complex queries to extract specific information from databases. Queries can involve filtering, sorting, joining, and aggregating data to fulfill various business requirements.
            <br><br>
            <b>Key Components of SQL:</b><br>
            Data Definition Language (DDL):
            <br>
            <image src="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/sql-commands.jpg" class="sql"></image>
            DDL commands are used to define and manage database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.
            Common DDL commands include CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and TRUNCATE.<br>
            Data Manipulation Language (DML):
            <br>
            DML commands are used to manipulate data within database tables.
            Common DML commands include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.<br>
            Data Control Language (DCL):
            <br>
            DCL commands are used to manage access permissions and security within the database.
            Common DCL commands include GRANT and REVOKE.<br>
            Data Query Language (DQL):
            <br>
            DQL commands are used to retrieve data from one or more database tables.
            The primary DQL command is SELECT, which is used to specify the columns to retrieve and the conditions for filtering data.
           <br><br> <b>SQL Statements:</b><br>
            CREATE TABLE:
            <br>
            Creates a new table in the database with specified columns and constraints.<br>
            INSERT INTO:
            <br>
            Inserts new records into a table with specified values.<br>
            SELECT FROM:
            <br>
            Retrieves data from one or more tables based on specified conditions.<br>
            UPDATE:
            <br>
            Modifies existing records in a table based on specified criteria.<br>
            DELETE FROM:
            <br>
            Deletes records from a table based on specified conditions.<br>
            ALTER TABLE:
            <br>
            Modifies the structure of an existing table, such as adding or dropping columns.<br>
            DROP TABLE:
            <br>
            Deletes an existing table from the database.<br><br>
            <b>Advanced SQL Concepts:</b><br>
            Joins:
            <br>
            SQL supports various types of joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN) to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.
           <br> Aggregate Functions:
            <br>
            SQL provides functions like SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, and COUNT for performing calculations on groups of rows.
           <br> Subqueries:
            <br>
            Subqueries allow nesting one SQL query inside another, enabling more complex data retrieval and manipulation.
            <br>Transactions:
            <br>
            SQL supports transaction management, allowing multiple database operations to be grouped together as a single unit of work</p>
