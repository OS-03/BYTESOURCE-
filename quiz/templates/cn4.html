            <h2>OSI Model</h2>
            <p>
                The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and describe how different networking technologies interact. It consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific functions related to data transmission and communication. The OSI model provides a standardized way to conceptualize and implement networking protocols and technologies, enabling interoperability between different network devices and systems.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Physical Layer</h3>
            <p>
                The physical layer is the lowest layer of the OSI model and deals with the physical transmission of data over a communication medium. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural aspects of transmitting raw data between devices. Examples of physical layer technologies include Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and fiber optics.

            <h3>2. Data Link Layer</h3>
            <p>
                The data link layer is responsible for establishing and maintaining a reliable link between adjacent nodes on a network. It handles issues such as framing, error detection, and flow control. Ethernet and PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) are examples of data link layer protocols.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Network Layer</h3>
            <p>
                The network layer is concerned with routing packets of data from the source to the destination across multiple networks. It determines the optimal path for data transmission, handles addressing, and performs logical addressing. IP (Internet Protocol) is a prominent example of a network layer protocol.
            </p>
            <h3>4. Transport Layer</h3>
            <p>
                The transport layer ensures reliable end-to-end communication between host devices. It manages data segmentation, reassembly, flow control, and error correction. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are common transport layer protocols.
            </p>
            <h3>5. Session Layer</h3>
            <p>
                The session layer establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions between applications. It manages session synchronization, checkpointing, and recovery mechanisms. Session layer protocols facilitate interactions between different applications running on networked devices.
            </p>
            <h3>6. Presentation Layer</h3>
            <p>
                The presentation layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression to ensure that data exchanged between applications is in a format that the receiving application can understand. It handles tasks such as data encryption, character encoding, and data compression.
            </p>
            <h3>7. Application Layer</h3>
            <p>
                The application layer provides network services directly to end-users and applications. It enables users to access network resources and services, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing. Protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS operate at the application layer.
            </p>
            <p>
                By organizing network communication into distinct layers, the OSI model simplifies network design, troubleshooting, and implementation. Each layer performs specific functions, and protocols at each layer interact with corresponding layers on other devices to facilitate communication and data exchange across networks.
